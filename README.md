INTRODUCTION:
------------

The aim of the project is to create an application that can search through Instagram (and other sources in the future) for images by location, hashtag and reverse image searching.

USER STORIES:
------------

```
As a user,
So that I can use the website,
I want to be able to sign up via Instagram.

As a user,
So that I am able to search images,
I want to be able to see the latest images from Instagram.

As a user,
So that I can choose images based on location,
I want to be able to see the images as thumbnails on a map.

As a user,
So that I can decide whether I can decide whether to view it on Instagram or not,
I want to be able to see more details when I click on the thumbnail on the map.

As a user,
So that I can narrow down my search,
I want to be able to filter my search by hashtags and /or date.

As a user,
So that I can further narrow down my search,
I want to be able to chain multiple hashtags.

As a user,
So that I know what I last searched for,
I want my search history to be loaded by default on my landing page.
```
